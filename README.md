# Django

## Introduction
### API - Application Programming Interface
    It is a set of protocals and tools that allows different applications to communicate each other. Apis enables us to create a complex applications by leveraging existing functionalities.
    Private APIs - within org, Partnered - Business, Public - 3rd party developer
    Since we are communicating with different application we need a common language that is JSON, or xml
### Urls in the django
    https://amazon.com/movies/reviews/

    Base Url : https://amazon.com/
    endpoint: movies/reviews

    Different kinds of urls
    https://amazon.com/movies/127/
    https://amazon.com/movies/127/reviews/
    https://amazon.com/movies/127/reviews/?limt=20
### Rest Api
    Representational State Transfer
    Rest is an architectural style.  
    Fouses on 1)endpoints 2)Methods(CRUD) - Create(Post), Read(Get), Update(Put), Delete(Delete) 3)headers 4)data
### Why do we need virtual enviroment
    Virtual evironment is a isolated environment where we can install multiple packages to run the application without installing in the system.
    Suppose I need iam working in project 1 where i require python 2.1 and pandas to run the application i need to create virtual env 1
    if i want to work on other project 2 where i require python 3.7 i can use this in virtual env 2
## Create Modal in django
    from django.db import models
    class Movie(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        description = models.TextField(max_length=200)
        active = models.BooleanField(default=True)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name
    Register in the admin
    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Movie
    admin.site.register(Movie)
    I can see the admin the browser http://localhost:8000/admin/
## Creating a view using JsonResponse
    from django.http import JsonResponse
    from .models import Movie
    class MoviesList(request):
        movies = Movies.objects.all()
        return JsonResponse({"movies":list(movies.values())}) # since JsonResponse require dictonary we have converted queryset to normal set and made key value pair

    In the urls add this
    urlpatterns = [
        path("movies/", movie_list, name="list-movies")
    ]
## How queryset works
    queryset is a special type of list that is used by django for faster retrival.
    movies = Movie.objects.all()
        Querset [<Movie:RRR>, <Movie:Kalki>]
        Since we have used self.name as return for __str__ during database creation
    movies = Movie.objects.all().values()
        Queryset [{name:"RRR", description:"Hello", active:true}, {...}]
    Convert queryset to normal list
    data = list(Movie.objects.all().values())

    How filter or get method works
    movie = Movie.objects.all().filter(name=name).first()
        # Now movie is not query set it is an object if i want to pass to JsonResponse i need to make it as dictionary
    data = {"name":movie.name, "description":movie.description, "active":movie.active}
